# iotLightBulb

Arduino Project. 

 - This is a simple Internet of Things (IoT) project that allows users to control a light source using a mobile phone, web browser, or tablet. The project utilizes a web server implemented in Node.js and employs bash(as kind of Lambda invoke) functions to invoke command-line interface commands on an Arduino device, enabling users to turn the light on or off and adjust the color of the light (e.g. light bulbs).
